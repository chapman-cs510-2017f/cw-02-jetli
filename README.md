# CS510 CW 2

**Author(s):** **CHANGEME**

## Specification

Complete the following exercises, saving your solutions in the indicated files. 

1. If needed, review the [Linux/Bash Slides](https://slides.com/profdressel/linux-bash-overview) and the [Vim Slides](https://slides.com/profdressel/vim-overview) you read for homework.
1. Using vim in a terminal (for practice), write a bash program ```helloworld.sh``` that simply prints "Hello world." (with a new line at the end) to the screen, and properly exits with the success code of 0. Make sure the top line of the program is the line ```#!/bin/bash``` that tells linux to run the bash interpreter, and make sure you change the permissions of the script to be executable with ```chmod```. Verify that you can run the program from the same directory in a terminal with: ```./helloworld.sh```. Commit the script to GitHub.
1. Using vim in a terminal, write a bash program ```createfiles.sh``` that creates a directory ```tmpfiles``` in the working directory, then creates 100 files named ```file001.tmp``` to ```file100.tmp``` in that directory. After the files are created, append the line ```Temporary file XXX``` to each one, where "XXX" is the number in the filename. Make the script executable as in the previous exercise and verify that you can run the program from the same directory with: ```./createfiles.sh```. Commit the script to GitHub.
1. Using vim in a terminal, write a bash program ```countup.sh``` that takes one command line argument `n`, checks whether this argument `n` is a positive integer (exiting with error code 1 if not), then prints the sequence of space-separated positive integers "1 2 3 4 ... n" ending with the chosen number. Make the script executable in the same way as the previous exercises and verify that it works. Commit the script to GitHub.
1. Using vim in a terminal, write a bash program ```fibs.sh``` that takes one command line argument `n`, checks whether this argument `n` is a positive integer (exiting with error code 1 if not), then prints the sequence of space-separated Fibonacci numbers "1 1 2 3 5 8 . . . Fn" ending with the `n`th Fibonacci number Fn. Make the script executable in the same way as the previous exercises and verify that it works. Commit the script to GitHub.

## Assessment
(1) bash program:
scrips format:
#!/bin/bash
echo "hello word"
exit 0 #return success

command line:
~$ touch helloworld.sh
~$ vi helloworld.sh
~$ cat helloworld.sh
~$ chmod +x ./helloworld.sh  #don't miss ./ befre helloword.sh
~$ ./helloworld.sh
hello word
